#Javascript Bootstrap

Boot strap the development of your front end application with all of the
javascript that you need.

##Why?

For the most part, we all use a standard set of Open Source javascript
libraries for out front end applications. ie: JQuery, Backbone.js. Lets
cut out all of the manual work so that we can start working on our
project.

##What does it do?

Automatic downloading of javascript files needed for your project
(development and minifiied, when available). *Providing updates to
libraries may be a future option*

##How is it implemented?

In order to make this as useable as possible, js\_bootstrap is to be
provided as a vanilla bash script.

##Requirement

At the moment requirements should be the following:
+ bash
+ curl or wget
+ read and write permissions on the output directory
